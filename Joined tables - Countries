Here is a SQL query with joined tables to find top 10 countries:

SELECT d.country, COUNT (customer_id)
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT (customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10
