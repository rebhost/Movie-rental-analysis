Here is a SQL query with joined tables to find top 10 cities:

SELECT C.city, d.country, COUNT (customer_id)
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 
					'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Phillipines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
GROUP BY C.city, D.country
ORDER BY COUNT (customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10
