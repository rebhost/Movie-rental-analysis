Here is a SQL query to find top 10 movies based on revenue:

SELECT D.title, F.name AS genre, SUM(amount) AS revenue
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id=B.rental_id
INNER JOIN inventory C ON B.inventory_id=C.inventory_id
INNER JOIN film D ON C.film_id=D.film_id
INNER JOIN film_category E ON D.film_id=E.film_id
INNER JOIN category F ON E.category_id=F.category_id
GROUP BY D.title, genre
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 10
