Here is a SQL query to find the revenue in cities in the top 10 countries:

SELECT C.city, D.country, SUM(E.amount) AS revenue
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_ID = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 
    'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 
     'Philipines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
GROUP BY city, country
ORDER BY SUM(E.amount) DESC
LIMIT 10
